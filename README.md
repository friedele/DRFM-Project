## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Radar electronic jammers are evolving from hostile nations thus becoming more complex and presenting serious issues when a radar system is trying to interrogate the actual targets of interest. Electronic jammers that present a serious challenge are in a class called Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM).  DRFM techniques work by generating coherent false targets to the radar receiver based on an intercepted pulse signal from the radar transmitter. This will position false targets ahead or behind the radar target, thus masking the real target with false targets.  The false targets can also be manipulated in amplitude, phase, and frequency.

Traditional approaches to target detection and estimation for electronic jammers generally rely on parametric modeling, which can fail because it violates the strict assumptions of classical signal processing algorithms. The result is substantial algorithm performance degradation. Furthermore, parametric models to handle DRFM jammers are difficult to design and ineffective against an evolving DRFM technology.   The key to identifying opportunities for improved electronic jammer protection and signal processing in radars is to use machine learning techniques to challenge the underlying assumptions of the standard parametric approach to design and analyze radar systems

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have gained popularity in the last few years with the advent of faster high-performance computer systems which rely on GPUs for the best computational performance.  A CNN operates from a mathematical perspective and is used for non-trivial tasks such as image classification. CNNs have great performance while classifying images when they are very similar to the training dataset. However, little work has been done in developing realistic radar models which are ignoring radar environmental and antenna effects thus providing inaccurate simulation training datasets and credibility.  In addition, current publicly available research does not typically consider the five dimensions of a radar sensor, thus presenting an incomplete signal processing chain. From a first principles perspective, the radar measures the following aspects of a signal target return:  Range, azimuth, elevation, Doppler, and signal amplitude.

We propose to design a CNN that will use spatial training datasets, where the radar signal processing concerning DRFM jamming will be examined to identify and classify DRFM-type jammers.  The CNN will use range-Doppler images as inputs to classify if our ground-based phased array radar system is being jammed by DRFM false targets. A suitable network architecture and values for hyperparameters are found by iterative experimental studies.  The correct classification of DRFM targets is what we desire while processing through the radar signal returns. The predictive quality of our CNN model will drive the radar system performance and support any further actions to mitigate a DRFM jammer attack.

This will give you the large highlight bar
```

For other install options, please refer to [Cookiecutter installation manual](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### Usage



#### Manual setup

Please follow these steps for manual setup:

1. [Download the precompiled template](https://github.com/dec0dOS/amazing-github-template/releases/download/latest/template.zip)
2. Replace all the [variables](#variables-reference) to your desired values
3. Initialize the repo in the precompiled template folder

    `or`

    Move the necessary files from precompiled template folder to your existing project directory. Don't forget the `use backticks to get this type of display` directory that may be hidden by default in your operating system
